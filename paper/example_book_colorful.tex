        Optimal transport is something many hear about but only a few understand the mechanism.
        This project was a great occasion for understanding what can be done in this field
        (and its connexion with the world of finance) as well as having a glimpse at the process of academical cooperation.

        I am deeply thankful to Professor and Professor for this great opportunity
        that I have been given, of being supervised and working together with them.
        Professor was very warm as well as supportive and
        both were very available and always gave me great feedbacks.

        I would also like to highlight how grateful I am to professor
        who has followed my learning for a year and a half. Next to him, I am learning more about mathematics and about myself.
        He was the reason why I connected to this project and it is thanks to him that I can study such interesting topics.

        I would also like to thank ETH for offering the opportunity of writing semester papers to their students,
        without which, doing projects among other lectures would be much more challenging.

        Finally, I’m grateful for the genuine pieces of advice and thoughtful discussions
        I had with my friends, in particular, I am thinking of
